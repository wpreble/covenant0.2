## About

Covenant is an AI Agent ecosystem built for digital sovereignty. It empowers individuals, businesses, and communities to create and own AI agents that are fully aligned with their true interests—not those of corporations or governments.

### Why AI Alignment Matters

Social media reshaped how we see the world, often at the cost of our autonomy. AI will go even further—it won't just filter reality; it will become an extension of our mind.

> If we don't own our AI models, they will own us.

Covenant ensures that your AI works for you, and only you. By leveraging open-source AI models, private data management, and decentralized governance, we're building a future where AI serves as a trusted partner—not an exploitative tool.

✓ Open-source AI models
✓ Private data management
✓ Decentralized governance
✓ Aligned with your interests

The flagship Covenant Agent is a personal assistant named Michxl. Michxl is not just a generic chatbot, but a "Jarvis" like digital guardian.

Unlike corporate AI assistants, Michxl runs on open-source AI models, has a unique personality, and will become progressively decentralized over time.

Built on Covenant's modular agent architecture, Michxl evolves with you—upgrading seamlessly while safeguarding your digital sovereignty.
